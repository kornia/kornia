Computer Vision Algorithms
==========================

Kornia provides a bottom to top granularity for **CURATED** Computer Vision algorithms.

In this section, we showcase our high-level API in terms of abstraction for common Computer Vision algorithms
that can be used across different domains such as Robotics, Industrial applications or for the AR/VR industry.

.. tip::

   Expect to see in the future a selection of the top performing algorithms in the following sub-areas:

   - Super Resolution
   - Deep Edge detection
   - Stereo and Optical flow and camera calibration
   - Neural Rendering
   - Semantic and Panoptic segmentation
   - Object Detection and Tracking
   - Image classification

.. admonition:: We are looking for contributors !!

   If you have any suggestion, proposal or just want to give us a hand - join our `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/kornia/shared_invite/zt-csobk21g-CnydWe5fmvkcktIeRFGCEQ>`_
