Kornia AI Organization
======================

The Kornia AI organization
--------------------------

Kornia AI is the non-profit organization registered in Spain that maintains the Kornia library
and its related projects.

Kornia AI is a community-driven project with the goal to accelerate research, development and deployment of Computer Vision solutions
and is the organization behind the Kornia library and its ecosystem projects.

1. The association focuses on studying and disseminating knowledge in artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and free software, and aims to democratize access to these technologies.
2. It fosters an inclusive community for various stakeholders to promote innovation, development, and knowledge sharing in AI-related fields.
3. The organization facilitates discussions on ethical, philosophical, and practical aspects of AI, and organizes various activities to achieve its objectives.
4. Operating on a non-profit basis, the association prohibits using its name or symbols for profit-making activities, but encourages the use of public AI goods by third parties.

Membership
----------

The membership is open to anyone who is interested in the mission of the organization and is willing to contribute to its activities.
The membership is free of charge and is granted by the board of directors and can be revoked at any time if the member is not complying with the organization's rules or [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kornia/kornia/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Governance
----------

The governance of the project is based on the following principles:

Kornia adopts a governance structure by an altruist group of maintainers driven by the community requests. Kornia’s design philosophy sits on the inspiration from existing Computer Vision libraries such as OpenCV or TorchVision and mimics the same behaviour so that the user can experience a soft transition between frameworks.
