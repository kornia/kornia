Contribute to Kornia
====================

Everyone is welcomed to get involved with the project. There are different ways in how you can put your two cents:

1. Ask/Answer questions in the #kornia PyTorch Slack channel:

    - We suggest you to join the channel in order to get more involved to the PyTorch ecosystem.
    - Send an email to slack@pytorch.org in order to get access.
    - Please, don't use GitHub issues for Q&A.

2. Report bugs through GitHub issues:

    - Do a quick search first to see whether others reported a similar issue.
    - In case you find an unreported bug, please open a new ticket.
    - Try to provide as much information as possible.

3. Fix a bug or develop a feature from the roadmap:

    - We will always have an open ticket showing the current roadmap.
    - Pick an unassigned feature (or potentially propose new one) or an open bug ticket.
    - Follow the instructions from Developing Kornia in order to setup your development environment and start coding.
    - Checkout our coding conventions. See more details below.
    - Run the test framework locally and make sure all works as expected before sending a pull request.
    - Open a Pull Request, get the green light from the CI and get your code merged.

4. Donate resources to the project.
