Computer Vision 2.0
===================

In the next generation of computer vision, we seek to provide differentiable implementations for classical computer vision algorithms. Aiming at meaningful gradients, optimal transformations, and the new era of computer vision 2.0.

Kornia consists of a set of routines and differentiable modules to solve generic computer vision problems. At its core, the package uses PyTorch as its main backend both for efficiency and to take advantage of the reverse-mode auto-differentiation to define and compute the gradient of complex functions.
