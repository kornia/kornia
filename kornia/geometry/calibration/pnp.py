    r"""This function attempts to solve the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem using Direct Linear Transform (DLT).

    Given a batch (where batch size is :math:`B`) of :math:`N` 3D points
    (where :math:`N \geq 6`) in the world space, a batch of :math:`N`
    corresponding 2D points in the image space and a batch of
    intrinsic matrices, this function tries to estimate a batch of
    world to camera transformation matrices.

    This implementation needs at least 6 points (i.e. :math:`N \geq 6`) to
    provide solutions.

    This function cannot be used if all the 3D world points (of any element
    of the batch) lie on a line or if all the 3D world points (of any element
    of the batch) lie on a plane. This function attempts to check for these
    conditions and throws an AssertionError if found. Do note that this check
    is sensitive to the value of the svd_eps parameter.

    Another bad condition occurs when the camera and the points lie on a
    twisted cubic. However, this function does not check for this condition.

    Args:
        world_points : A tensor with shape :math:`(B, N, 3)` representing
          the points in the world space.
        img_points : A tensor with shape :math:`(B, N, 2)` representing
          the points in the image space.
        intrinsics : A tensor with shape :math:`(B, 3, 3)` representing
          the intrinsic matrices.
        weights : A tensor with shape :math:`(B, N)` representing the
            weights for each point. If None, all points are considered to be equally important.
        svd_eps : A small float value to avoid numerical precision issues.

    Returns:
        A tensor with shape :math:`(B, 3, 4)` representing the estimated world to
        camera transformation matrices (also known as the extrinsic matrices).
