    r"""Reconstructs a bunch of points by triangulation.

    Triangulates the 3d position of 2d correspondences between several images.
    Reference: Internally it uses DLT method from Hartley/Zisserman 12.2 pag.312

    The input points are assumed to be in homogeneous coordinate system and being inliers
    correspondences. The method does not perform any robust estimation.

    Args:
        P1: The projection matrix for the first camera with shape :math:`(*, 3, 4)`.
        P2: The projection matrix for the second camera with shape :math:`(*, 3, 4)`.
        points1: The set of points seen from the first camera frame in the camera plane
          coordinates with shape :math:`(*, N, 2)`.
        points2: The set of points seen from the second camera frame in the camera plane
          coordinates with shape :math:`(*, N, 2)`.

    Returns:
        The reconstructed 3d points in the world frame with shape :math:`(*, N, 3)`.
