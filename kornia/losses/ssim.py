    r"""Compute a loss based on the SSIM measurement.

    The loss, or the Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) is described as:

    .. math::

      \text{loss}(x, y) = \frac{1 - \text{SSIM}(x, y)}{2}

    Convention:
        - See the Convention block of :func:`~kornia.metrics.ssim` for the window, the border and ``max_val``.
        - The per-pixel loss is the structural dissimilarity clamped to :math:`[0, 1]`,
          ``clamp((1 - SSIM) / 2, 0, 1)``; :ref:`Losses and metrics <losses-metrics-conventions>` relates it to the
          ``1 - SSIM`` loss. The clamp acts only where roundoff pushes the map outside :math:`[-1, 1]`, as for images
          with a large constant offset.
        - The default ``reduction='mean'`` averages every element; ``'none'`` keeps the shape of the SSIM map.
        - Known defect: ``padding`` is not validated, as in :func:`~kornia.metrics.ssim`
          (`#5537 <https://github.com/kornia/kornia/issues/5537>`_).

    Args:
        img1: the first input image with shape :math:`(B, C, H, W)`.
        img2: the second input image with shape :math:`(B, C, H, W)`.
        window_size: the size of the gaussian kernel to smooth the images.
        max_val: the dynamic range of the images.
        eps: Small value for numerically stability when dividing.
        reduction : Specifies the reduction to apply to the
         output: ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
         ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of elements
         in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed.
        padding: ``'same'`` | ``'valid'``. Whether to only use the "valid" convolution
         area to compute SSIM to match the MATLAB implementation of original SSIM paper.

    Returns:
        The loss based on the ssim index.

    Examples:
        >>> input1 = torch.rand(1, 4, 5, 5)
        >>> input2 = torch.rand(1, 4, 5, 5)
        >>> loss = ssim_loss(input1, input2, 5)
