    The loss, or the Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) is described as:

      \text{loss}(x, y) = \frac{1 - \text{SSIM}(x, y)}{2}

    See :meth:`~kornia.losses.ssim` for details about SSIM.

    Args:
        img1: the first input image with shape :math:`(B, C, D, H, W)`.
        img2: the second input image with shape :math:`(B, C, D, H, W)`.
        window_size: the size of the gaussian kernel to smooth the images.
        max_val: the dynamic range of the images.
        eps: Small value for numerically stability when dividing.
        reduction : Specifies the reduction to apply to the
         output: ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
         ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of elements
         in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed.
        padding: ``'same'`` | ``'valid'``. Whether to only use the "valid" convolution
         area to compute SSIM to match the MATLAB implementation of original SSIM paper.

    Returns:
        The loss based on the ssim index.

    Examples:
        >>> input1 = torch.rand(1, 4, 5, 5, 5)
        >>> input2 = torch.rand(1, 4, 5, 5, 5)
