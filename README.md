*Kornia* is a differentiable computer vision library for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).

It consists of a set of routines and differentiable modules to solve generic computer vision problems. At its core, the package uses *PyTorch* as its main backend both for efficiency and to take advantage of the reverse-mode auto-differentiation to define and compute the gradient of complex functions.

## Overview

Inspired by existing packages, this library is composed by a subset of packages containing operators that can be inserted within neural networks to train models to perform image transformations, epipolar geometry, depth estimation, and low-level image processing such as filtering and edge detection that operate directly on tensors.

At a granular level, Kornia is a library that consists of the following components:

| **Component**                                                                    | **Description**                                                                                                                       |
