# Developing Kornia

To start to develop, please follow the steps below:

1. Fork the [kornia repository](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) by clicking on the
[fork](https://github.com/kornia/kornia/fork) button on the repository page. This will create a copy of the Kornia
repository under your GitHub account.


2. Clone your fork of Kornia, and add the Kornia repository as a remote:
    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:<your Github username>/kornia.git
    $ cd kornia
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/kornia/kornia.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch with a meaningful name reflecting your contribution. See an example:
    ```bash
    $ git checkout upstream/main -b feat/foo_feature
    # or
    $ git checkout upstream/main -b fix/bar_bug
    ```
    ðŸš¨ **Do not** work on the `main` branch!

4. Creating a development environment

    **Using kornia script (Recommended)**

    Kornia now uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python package management and virtual environment creation.
    The `setup_dev_env.sh` script will automatically install uv (if not already installed), create a virtual environment,
    and install all development dependencies including PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA version.

    ```bash
    $ ./setup_dev_env.sh
    ```

    This script will:
    - Install uv if it's not already available
    - Create a virtual environment in the `./venv` directory
    - Install PyTorch with the appropriate CUDA version (default CUDA 12.1)
    - Install all development dependencies using uv dependency groups
    - Install documentation dependencies using uv dependency groups

    You can customize the Python version, PyTorch version, and CUDA version using environment variables:
    ```bash
    $ PYTHON_VERSION=3.10 PYTORCH_VERSION=2.4.0 CUDA_VERSION=11.8 ./setup_dev_env.sh
    ```

    To use CPU-only PyTorch:
    ```bash
    $ PYTORCH_MODE=cpuonly ./setup_dev_env.sh
    ```

    **Using justfile commands (Recommended)**

    Kornia provides a `justfile` with convenient commands for development tasks. The justfile automatically
    ensures the virtual environment is set up before running any commands.

    To see all available commands:
    ```bash
    $ just
    ```

    To run tests:
    ```bash
    $ just test-cpu        # Run CPU tests
    $ just test-cuda       # Run CUDA tests
    $ just test-all        # Run all tests
    ```

    To run linting and type checking:
    ```bash
    $ just lint            # Run code formatting and linting
    $ just mypy            # Run type checking
    ```

    **Manually setup with uv**

    If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

    1. Install uv:
    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # Or using pip
    $ pip install uv
    ```

    2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    $ uv venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    3. Install PyTorch with appropriate CUDA version:
    ```bash
    # For CUDA 12.1 (default)
    $ uv pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

    # For CPU-only
    $ uv pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    ```

    4. Install Kornia development dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ uv pip install -e .[dev,x]
    $ uv pip install -e .[docs]  # For documentation development
    ```

    **Attention**: If *Kornia* was already installed in your virtual environment, remove it with
    `uv pip uninstall kornia` before reinstalling it in editable mode with the `-e` flag.

    **Dependency Management with uv.lock**

    Kornia uses a `uv.lock` file for reproducible dependency management. This ensures all developers get exactly
    the same versions of dependencies:

    - **Adding dependencies**: Add new dependencies to the appropriate section in `pyproject.toml`:
      - Main dependencies: `dependencies = [...]`
      - Dev dependencies: `optional-dependencies.dev = [...]`
      - Docs dependencies: `optional-dependencies.docs = [...]`
      - Extra dependencies: `optional-dependencies.x = [...]`

    - **Updating the lock file**: After adding dependencies, regenerate the lock file:
      ```bash
      $ just lock-update
      # or: uv lock --upgrade
      ```

    - **Installing from lock file**: The setup script automatically uses the lock file when available:
      ```bash
      $ just sync  # Install dependencies from lock file
      # or: uv sync --frozen
      ```

    - **Updating specific packages**:
      ```bash
      $ uv lock --upgrade-package <package-name>
      ```

    Always commit both your `pyproject.toml` changes AND the updated `uv.lock` file together.

5. Develop the code on your branch, and before creating the pull request, make sure to ensure the code passes the checks.

    As you develop your code, you should also create test cases for your code. As well as, In addition to ensuring that
    the other tests continue to pass. You can run the tests with:
    ```bash
    $ pytest tests/<TEST_TO_RUN>.py --dtype=float32,float64 --device=all
    ```
    With the `dtype` argument, run the tests using tensors with all `dtypes` desired. Options: `bfloat16`, `float16`,
    `float32`, `float64`, and `all`.

    In the same way, the `device`, will run the tests using tensors on the `device` desired. Options: `cpu`, `cuda`,
    `tpu`, `mps`, and `all`.


    Kornia relies on [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run code quality tools. Make sure to have `pre-commit`
    under your dev environment, otherwise, you can install the tools manually and run them with the help of the available
    commands of the [Makefile](./Makefile). Read more about the code standards adopted [here](#coding-standards).

# Contributing to Documentation

We welcome contributions to the Kornia documentation! If you'd like to improve our docs, please follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment as described in the [Developing Kornia](#developing-kornia) section above.

2. Make your changes to the documentation files located in the `docs/` directory.

3. Build the documentation using the provided Makefile:

   ```bash
   $ make build-docs
   ```

   This command will delete any previously built files and generate the newest version of the documentation.

4. The built documentation will be available in the `docs/build/html/` directory. You can open the main page in your browser by running:

   ```bash
   $ open docs/build/html/index.html
   ```

5. Review your changes in the browser to ensure they appear as expected.

6. Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them and submit a pull request following the guidelines in the [Pull Request](#pull-request) section below.

## Benchmarking

We have a benchmark suite configured in [benchmarks/](./benchmarks/). We used the
 [pytest-benchmark](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-benchmark/) library to benchmark our function units.

Our [Makefile](./Makefile) has an `benchmark` command as an alias on how to run our benchmarks.

```console
# To run all suite
$ make benchmark

# To run a specific file you can pass `BENCHMARK_SOURCE`
$ make benchmark BENCHMARK_SOURCE=benchmarks/augmentation/2d_geometric_test.py

# To run a specific benchmark you use `BENCHMARK_SOURCE` as the pytest standard behaviour
$ make benchmark BENCHMARK_SOURCE=benchmarks/augmentation/2d_geometric_test.py::test_aug_2d_elastic_transform

# To update the optimizer backends desired to execute you can pass `BENCHMARK_BACKENDS=`
$ make benchmark BENCHMARK_BACKENDS='inductor,eager'

# To pass other options to the runner, you can use `BENCHMARK_OPTS`
# Example, setup to run the benchmark on cuda on verbose mode
$ make benchmark BENCHMARK_OPTS='--device=cuda -vv'
```

We use the same tests generator suite, so you can set up the device within `--device`, the dtype within
`--dtype`, and the optimizer backend within `--optimizer`.

The optimizer backend supported on the suite, is the torch compile backend on non-experimental mode,
 and the `''` or `None` which will do the same as `eager` mode and do anything, and `'jit'` which will
 try to `torch.jit.script` the operation.

You can use the `BENCHMARK_OPTS` on `make benchmark` to overload the default options we use on pytest-benchmark.

We are using as default:
- the warmup, because the optimizer/jit may had an overhead.
- the group: to display the benchmark per each test
- the precision: to have a better precision on the results
- the default for `BENCHMARK_BACKENDS` are `'inductor,eager'`.
- the default for `BENCHMARK_SOURCE` is `benchmarks/`.

You can also run the benchmark within docker:
```console
$ make benchmark-docker
```

which will build and run the image [docker/Dockerfile.benchmark](docker/Dockerfile.benchmark).
 The benchmark command can be used within `BENCHMARK_BACKENDS` and `BENCHMARK_SOURCE`.

# Coding Standards

This section provides general guidance for developing code for the project. The following rules will serve as a guide in
writing high-quality code that will allow us to scale the project and ensure that the code base remains readable and
maintainable.

- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.

- Write small incremental changes:

  - To have a linear and clean commits history, we recommend committing each small change that you do to the
    source code.
  - Clear commit messages will help to understand the progress of your work.
  - Please, avoid pushing large files.

- Add tests:
  - Tests are crucial and we expect you to write unit tests for each of the functionalities that you implement.
    It is also a good idea to group the tests for functionalities
  - At [testing/](./testing/) directory we have a bunch of functions to help you to produce meaningful tests. Feel free,
    to add any functionality that you think is essential and can be used with the test suite. Under this
    testing, directory should go all code which are needed under the tests and aren't tests or pytest configs (fixtures,
    etc).

    ```python
    from testing.base import BaseTester

    class TestMyFunction(BaseTester):
        # To compare the actual and expected tensors use `self.assert_close(...)`


        def test_smoke(self, device, dtype):
            # test the function with different parameters arguments, to check if the function at least runs with all the
            # arguments allowed.
            pass

        def test_exception(self, device, dtype):
            # tests the exceptions which can occur on your function

            # example of how to properly test your exceptions
            # with pytest.raises(<raised Error>) as errinfo:
            #     your_function(<set of parameters that raise the error>)
            # assert '<msg of error>' in str(errinfo)

            pass

        def test_cardinality(self, device, dtype):
            # test if with different parameters the shape of the output is the expected
            pass

        def test_feature_foo(self, device, dtype):
            # test basic functionality
            pass

        def test_feature_bar(self, device, dtype):
            # test another functionality
            pass

        def test_gradcheck(self, device):
            # test the functionality gradients
            # Uses `self.gradcheck(...)`
            pass

        def test_dynamo(self, device, dtype, torch_optimizer):
            #  test the functionality using dynamo optimizer

            # Example of how to properly test your function for dynamo
            # inputs = (...)
            # op = your_function
            # op_optimized = torch_optimizer(op)
            # self.assert_close(op(inputs), op_optimized(inputs))

            pass
    ```

- Tests should cover different devices (`CPU`, `CUDA`, etc), dtypes, and different input batch sizes. The `device`, and
  `dtype`, are generated from the arguments (`--dtype` and `--device`) as explained before. These arguments when invoking the
  tests suits with pytest, will generate all possibilities, providing fixtures for all functions. See an example:

    ```python
    import pytest

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("batch_size", [1, 2, 5])
    def test_smoke(batch_size, device, dtype):
        x = torch.rand(batch_size, 2, 3, device=device, dtype=dtype)
        assert x.shape == (batch_size, 2, 3)
    ```

- We give support to static type checker for Python >= 3.8

  - Please, read
    [MyPy cheatsheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html#type-hints-cheat-sheet-python-3) for
    Python 3.
  - It is recommended to use typing inside the function, **when** it would increase readability.
  - Try to use all things available under `kornia.core`, e.g. `from kornia.core import Tensor`
  - For modules which not support anymore `JIT` consider, adding `from __future__ import annotations`, to enable the
    new features of typing.
  - **Always** type function input and output, e.g.:
    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations
    from kornia.core import Tensor

    def homography_warp(
      patch_src: Tensor,
      dst_homo_src: Tensor,
      dsize: tuple[int, int],
      mode: str = 'bilinear',
      padding_mode: str = 'zeros'
    ) -> Tensor:
    ```

- We suggest using new Python 3's f-Strings improved string formatting syntax:

  Guidelines: [PEP 498 - Literal String Interpolation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/)

- Format your code:

  - We follow [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008).
  - Use `pre-commit` to autoformat each commit before push: [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com)
    To do so, just install it for this repository by running the command: `pre-commit install` on your terminal

- Changes to PEP8:
  - Line length is 120 characters.
  - W504 (line break after binary operator) is sometimes acceptable. E.g.

    ```python
    determinant = A[:, :, 0:1, 0:1] * A[:, :, 1:2, 1:2] -
                  A[:, :, 0:1, 1:2] * A[:, :, 1:2, 0:1])
    ```

-  Using 3rd party libraries:
  - Everything from the standard library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/) is OK.
    It doesnâ€™t mean, that one should import `urllib` just because, but doing it when needed is fine.
